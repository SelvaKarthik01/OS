# OS-Assignment
# CONCLUSION:

Given the above analysis, the best strategy to choose is:
Banker's Algorithm & First-Come First-Server
Efficiency: It has the lowest total execution times across all robots while still completing the maximum number of tasks.

Resource Management: It shows effective resource usage, minimizing the total resources needed compared to the other strategies.

Consistency: All robots completed the same number of tasks with lower execution times, indicating that this strategy allows for reliable performance without overloading the system.
